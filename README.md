## Abstract

This is the repository for a streaming show I put out weekly, on various topics
related to programming, computer science, programming games, math excursions,
odd philosophies, and ill-fated projects. 


## Next episode

- S1.5E2: Fri 23 May 2025: Let's add some automation to how I mange the OHR page
- S1.5E3: Sat 24 May 2025: Music? Let's use SonicPI. New Graphics? Let's use Manim!
- S1.5E4: Mon 26 May 2025: Dress rehearsal for Tuesday night

## Future Schedule

- S2E1: Tue 27 May 2025: Reboot of the On Home Row show, discussion about future content, ideas for topics...
