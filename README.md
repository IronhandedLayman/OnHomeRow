On Home Row
-----------

## Abstract

This is the repository for a streaming show I put out weekly, on various topics
related to programming, computer science, programming games, math excursions,
odd philosophies, and ill-fated projects. 


## Next episode

- S2E1: Tue 27 May 2025: Reboot of the On Home Row show, discussion about future content, ideas for topics...

## Future Schedule

- S2E2: Wed 28 May 2025: (Possible) Making a sudoku game/engine/puzzle
- S2E3: Thu 29 May 2025: (Possible) Setting up NixOS from the ground up on a small test system

## Time of the stream:

Currently, I need this stream to be irregular, until I get into a flow that allows me to work and play with this channel.
