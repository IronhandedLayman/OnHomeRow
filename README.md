## Abstract

This is the repository for a streaming show I put out at least on Mondays at 10pm EST, on various topics related to programming, computer science, programming games, math excursions, odd philosophies, and ill-fated projects. 

## Previous episodes

- Project minus episodes (about setting up the channel, playing with streaming, and getting the OBS logic right)
- -5: 25 Jan
- -4: 27 Jan
- -3: 30 Jan
- -2.5: 31 Jan
- -1: 2 Feb

Officially numbered episodes: (aired at 10pm EST unless otherwise specified)

- Ep. 1: Mon 7 Feb 2022: Crash course on Boolean algebra, and some way to automatically draw some circuits with Manim to use in discussing the logic in Turing Complete.
- Ep. 2: Tue 8 Feb 2022: More manim work and some experimentation on how to livestream the demonstrations I would like to use. 
- Ep. 3: Thu 10 Feb 2022: Inaugural playthrough of Turing Complete, with the animations I'd like to use to illustrate points along the way.
- Ep. 4: Sun 13 Feb 2022: Day 2 of the playthrough, learning about memory and arithmetic if time allows 
- Ep. 5: Mon 14 Feb 2022(9pm EST): Project initiation: plan out the construction of an assembler.
- Ep. 6: Tue 15 Feb 2022: Turing Complete: Finishing arithmetic
- Ep. 7: Wed 16 Feb 2022: Assembler part 2: Learning the pyparsing library
- Ep. 8: Thu 17 Feb 2022(10:30pm EST): Turing Complete: Build the computer

## Time of the stream:
Every stream will be at 10pm EST unless otherwise scheduled or indicated. Every stream will last an hour unless the topic takes me over.

## Future Schedule

- Ep. 9: Sun 20 Feb 2022: Assembler part 3: Implementing OVERTURE
- Ep. 10: Mon 20 Feb 2022: Turing Complete: Programming levels with OVERTURE architecture
